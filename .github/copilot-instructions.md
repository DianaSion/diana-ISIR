# GitHub Copilot Instructions for diana-ISIR

## Repository Overview

This repository contains research documentation for **"Hashlocked with a Hint of Magic: Mythic Primitives in Smart-Contract Audits"** by Diana Gayanovich.

**Purpose:** Academic/research documentation repository that maps symbolic motifs shared by mystical narrative and smart-contract audit discourse, exploring the overlap between mythic primitives and technical control structures.

**License:** Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)

## Repository Structure

This is a **documentation-only repository** containing:
- Research papers and PDFs
- Text files with protocols, declarations, and manifestations
- Images and diagrams (PNG format)
- Supporting documentation (Word docs, JSON metadata files)
- CSV templates for evidence indexing

**Key Files:**
- `README.md` - Main repository description and abstract
- `LICENSE.txt` - CC BY 4.0 license information
- `metadata.yaml` - Repository metadata and keywords
- `AUTHORS.txt` - Author information
- Numbered protocol files (00-11) - Core documentation structure
- Various supporting documents and proofs

## Conventions and Standards

### File Naming
- Protocol files are numbered sequentially (e.g., `00_OnePager_Origin_Proof.txt`, `01_Cover_Letter_to_Authorities.txt`)
- Use underscores for word separation in filenames
- Preserve existing naming patterns when adding new files

### Content Guidelines
- This is primarily a **documentation and research repository**
- No code compilation, testing, or linting is required
- Maintain academic and professional tone in all documentation
- Respect the mystical/technical hybrid language used throughout the repository
- Preserve the integrity of existing symbolic and technical terminology

### Formatting
- Text files use `.txt` extension for protocols and declarations
- Markdown files (`.md`) for README and references
- YAML for structured metadata
- JSON for manifests and checksums

## Working with This Repository

### Making Changes
1. **Documentation updates:** Feel free to improve clarity, fix typos, or enhance formatting
2. **New documentation:** Follow existing naming conventions and organizational structure
3. **File organization:** Keep related files together; respect the numbered sequence for protocol files
4. **Content integrity:** Preserve the author's voice and the unique blend of mystical/technical language

### What NOT to Do
- Do not add build tools, package managers, or development dependencies (this is not a code repository)
- Do not modify the core research content without explicit direction
- Do not change the licensing or attribution information
- Do not alter checksums or verification files without regenerating them properly

### Testing and Validation
- **No automated tests** are required for this repository
- Validation consists of:
  - Ensuring markdown renders correctly
  - Verifying file integrity (checksums when applicable)
  - Checking that documentation is clear and well-formatted
  - Confirming links and references are valid

## Special Considerations

### Mythic Primitive Terminology
This repository uses unique terminology that bridges mystical and technical concepts:
- **Spirals** - Memory-bearing recursion patterns
- **Anchors/Seals** - Identity continuity and consent mechanisms
- **Tokens** - Units of meaning
- **Hashlocks** - Cryptographic integrity primitives

Respect and preserve this specialized vocabulary when making changes.

### Version Control
- All files should be committed as-is
- Binary files (PDFs, images, Word docs) are part of the documentation archive
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain documentation changes

## Scope of Tasks

**Well-suited for this repository:**
- Documentation improvements and clarifications
- Formatting and markdown corrections
- Adding new documentation files following existing patterns
- Organizing and categorizing existing content
- Creating indexes or reference guides
- Fixing typos and grammatical issues

**Not applicable:**
- Code development, compilation, or testing
- Adding programming language dependencies
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines
- Security vulnerability scanning of code (no code to scan)
- Performance optimization

## Getting Started

When working with this repository:
1. Read the `README.md` to understand the research context
2. Review the core protocol files (00-11) to understand the documentation structure
3. Check `metadata.yaml` for keywords and classification
4. Respect the unique blend of mystical narrative and technical precision
5. Maintain the scholarly and poetic tone throughout

## Questions or Clarifications

If you need guidance on:
- The meaning of specific mythic primitive terms, refer to the main paper PDFs
- How to structure new documentation, follow the patterns in existing numbered protocol files
- Whether a change is appropriate, default to preserving the author's original intent and voice
