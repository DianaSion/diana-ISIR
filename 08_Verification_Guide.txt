Anchor (Merkle Root): 1bf4875dd4e05afc74cd00605cadf43cf0ed0c6643ec2395fcd1754aedb37509

1) Compute a file's SHA-256 (Windows: Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256; macOS/Linux: shasum -a 256).
2) Find the row in merkle_leaves.csv that lists that SHA-256; copy its proof.
3) Hash the proof upward; it must recompute to the Anchor above.
If it matches, the file is part of my constellation (no platform or opinion required).
